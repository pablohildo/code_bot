# CodeBot

CodeBot is a Work in Progress!

Through [Glot.io](http://glot.io) this bot intends to implement a way to run code through Discord text chat. Main priorities right now are functional programming languages, since it's main use case is a functional programming Discord server (@funcional-ssa).

## Priorities

- [X] Correctly define consumer responsibilities and separations
- [ ] Implement command to run code
- [X] Modularize commands, similar to cogs
- [ ] Implement languages' implicit structure, prioritized as seen in [Implemented Languages](#implemented-languages)

## Implemented Languages

- [ ] Elixir
- [ ] Elm
- [ ] Haskell
- [ ] Clojure
- [ ] Scala
- [ ] F#
- [ ] Rust
- [ ] Idris
- [ ] Whatever comes next (no more fp langs at Glot.io, seemingly)
